  <h3>How to play the GAME?</h3>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      You have to predict for ALL the Matches as per the schedule.
    </li>
    <li>
      The predictions will freeze 1 hour before the scheduled match timing for the respective match and all are
      expected
      to place the predictions before that.
    </li>
    <li>
      You need to predict the following for every match:
      <ol>
        <li>Winner – Name of the Team or a “Draw” for a Tie / Match Abandoned</li>
        <li>Toss – Team Winning the Toss</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li class="text-danger">
      Be careful while adding predictions, it cannot be changed once you have saved the prediction.
    </li>
  </ul>


  <h3>How to score POINTS?</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Points for Predictions:
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you predict the Winner correctly, you get 100 points else you lose 50 points.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can also predict a DRAW. (A draw is considered in case of a Tie and also if the match is abandoned due to
          weather
          or any other external factors!)

        </li>
        <li>
          If you predict a draw and the match ends in a draw you get 100 points. If you predict a draw and the match has
          a
          winner, you lose 50 points.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you do not predict you lose 100 points.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Points for Toss:
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you predict the Winner of the Toss correctly, you get 50 points else you lose 25 points.
        </li>
