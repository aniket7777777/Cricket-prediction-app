  <h3>How to play the GAME?</h3>
  <p>
    <br>- You have to predict for ALL the Matches as per the schedule.
    <br>- The predictions will freeze 1 hour before the scheduled match timing for the respective match and all are
    expected
    to place the predictions before that.
    <br>- You need to predict the following for every match:
    <br>1. Winner – Name of the Team or a “Draw” for a Tie / Match Abandoned
    <br>2. Toss – Team Winning the Toss
    <br>- Be careful while adding predictions, it cannot be changed once you have saved the prediction.
